This was a time of peace and prosperity, but also stagnation. The rise of Zeus and the Olympians marked the beginning of a new cosmic order—civilization, law, and justice replacing the raw elemental forces of the Titans.\n\n### Mount Olympus\n\nThe twelve major gods (Olympians) dwelt on Mount Olympus, the highest peak in Greece. From their divine palaces, they observed human affairs, intervening to reward piety or punish hubris.",

Below them ruled a celestial council of great gods who determined the fates of humans and the cosmos. Unlike later monotheistic traditions, these gods were not morally perfect but displayed human emotions and conflicts.\n\n### The Temple Economy\n\nMesopotamian cities were theocracies centered on the ziggurat temple, considered the literal dwelling place of the city's patron deity. The entire economy was organized around temple offerings, and kings ruled as stewards of the gods. The earliest written texts (cuneiform) were temple records, hymns, and myths.",
