The rise of Zeus and the Olympians marked the beginning of a new cosmic order—civilization, law, and justice replacing the raw elemental forces of the Titans.\n\n### Mount Olympus\n\nThe twelve major gods (Olympians) dwelt on Mount Olympus, the highest peak in Greece. From their divine palaces, they observed human affairs, intervening to reward piety or punish hubris.",
